Welcome to the MapHub Portal project (suggestions for better names welcome!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASICS
------
This is a Grails project. You need to download Grails from http://grails.org/ 
and set it up on your machine. (Don't forget to create a GRAILS_HOME variable, 
and to add the Grails /bin folder to your system PATH!)

FIRST STEPS
-----------
1. Clone the repository

2. In the "grails-app/conf" folder, locate the file "DataSource.groovy.template". 
   Create a copy of this file named "DataSource.groovy". You can edit the contents to
   match your local database settings, if you want (per default, you will be running
   on an in-memory database)

3. To verify everything is set up, change to the project folder, type
   "grails run-app", and go to http://localhost:8080/maphub-portal after the server
   has started.
