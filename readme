Welcome to the MapHub Portal project (suggestions for better names welcome!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASICS
------
This is a Grails project. You need to download Grails from http://grails.org/ 
and set it up on your machine. (Don't forget to create a GRAILS_HOME variable, 
and to add the Grails /bin folder to your system PATH!)

FIRST STEPS
-----------
1. Clone the repository

2. In the "grails-app/conf" folder, locate the file "DataSource.groovy.template". 
   Create a copy of this file named "DataSource.groovy". (Important: please don't
   just rename the file. If you do, you might accidentally delete the .template from
   the repository on your next commit!)
   You can edit the contents of DataSource.groovy to match your local database settings,
   if you want (per default, you will be running on an in-memory database)

3. To verify everything is set up, change to the project folder, type
   "grails run-app", and go to http://localhost:8080/maphub-portal after the server
   has started.
