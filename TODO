TODO
====

- add a "cover flow" view

- set all the default fields for maps when uploading (e.g. views to 0, uploadDate to current date, etc.)

- maybe make the "year" field not a selection but a keyboard input field with 4 digits

- make the search work

- add more details for map view

- See how we can fit in the "registration" and "forgot password" views into the new layout because they are somewhere in Spring Security and not in our project root

- Create a separate Admin "namespace", using the View Compartments plugin: https://github.com/kimble/grails-view-compartments

- Map upload form input verification

- Map file upload and tiling

DONE
====

- Werner: Basic map listing and installation of search plugin

- Werner: Create a Home controller with a basic interface (Login/Logout) - we don't need a specific home controller

- Werner: Find a nice and basic HTML/CSS template to apply to all pages

- Christian: Admin and user roles are now created during (development) bootstrapping. Decided to create one admin role and two user roles. Users are named "admin", "rwuser", and "rouser"; passwords are easy to guess
