TODO
====

- See how we can fit in the "registration" and "forgot password" views into the new layout because they are somewhere in Spring Security and not in our project root

- Create two user groups (Admin/User), the latter with a flag to enable map uploads

- Create a separate Admin "namespace", using the View Compartments plugin: https://github.com/kimble/grails-view-compartments

- Make upload work for users with upload privileges and list of recently uploaded maps



DONE
====

- Werner: Create a Home controller with a basic interface (Login/Logout) - we don't need a specific home controller

- Werner: Find a nice and basic HTML/CSS template to apply to all pages
