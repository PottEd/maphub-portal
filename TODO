- AJAX stuff (username check, map upload: check if tileset is provided)

- Map file upload and tiling

DONE
====

- Christian: Admin and user roles are now created during (development) bootstrapping. Decided to create one admin role and two user roles. Users are named "admin", "rwuser", and "rouser"; passwords are easy to guess
