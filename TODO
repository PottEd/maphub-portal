# TODO

### Annotations

### Editing

- Edit sets (same code as for creating), see if it already works?
- Edit maps

### Browsing

- Bugfix for parameters like &user=1, &set=1 in MapController
- add functionality to browse maps by set (just add another parameter)
- add functionality to browse maps by user
- enable password editing for user profile

# NICE-TO-HAVE:

- maybe make the "year" field not a selection but a keyboard input field with 4 digits
- add openID/oauth support
- AJAX stuff (username check, map upload: check if tileset is provided)
- Map file upload and tiling
