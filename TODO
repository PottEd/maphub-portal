- New Model: Annotation. Associate Annotation to Map. Fields: Text, Replies

NICE-TO-HAVE:
=============

- maybe make the "year" field not a selection but a keyboard input field with 4 digits

- add openID/oauth support

- AJAX stuff (username check, map upload: check if tileset is provided)

- Map file upload and tiling
