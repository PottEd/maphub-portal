TODO
====

- maybe make the "year" field not a selection but a keyboard input field with 4 digits

- make the search work

- Map file upload and tiling

DONE
====

- Create a separate Admin "namespace", using the View Compartments plugin: https://github.com/kimble/grails-view-compartments shouldn't be necessary though, as we can scope everything through views.. I guess.

- Christian: Map upload form input verification

- Werner: Basic map listing and installation of search plugin

- Werner: Create a Home controller with a basic interface (Login/Logout) - we don't need a specific home controller

- Werner: Find a nice and basic HTML/CSS template to apply to all pages

- Christian: Admin and user roles are now created during (development) bootstrapping. Decided to create one admin role and two user roles. Users are named "admin", "rwuser", and "rouser"; passwords are easy to guess
